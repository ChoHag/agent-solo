One Agent

A tiny utility to ensure there is always an ssh agent available in a
known but secure location containing your unencrypted private keys.

Simply install it to ~/.profile with "make install" and a new shell
function 'agent' is available which ensures that an ssh-agent exists
and has all unencrypted identies added to it with a socket in ~/.ssh.

Arguments to agent are additional keys to add; they won't be decrypted.

agent -k will also kill all other ssh-agent processes that it can and
remove stale socks from /tmp.
